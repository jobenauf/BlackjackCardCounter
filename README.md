# BlackjackCardCounter
A Simple Card Counting Program Written in Python
This is a simple Python program that you can use to count cards in Blackjack (don't use this for anything other than experimentation without real money...;)). You can input the cards on the table in the format of k for king, j for jack, a for ace, q for queen and 2, 3, 4 etc, then press enter and the program will calculate the current true count of the current shoe. 
This can continue on indefinitely or until the dealer puts out a new shoe.
